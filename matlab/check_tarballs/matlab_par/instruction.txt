STEP 1: Creating Profile
	Need to create a cluster profile through matlab GUI
	(This can be done on aci-i)

	Creating Torque profile from "Manage Cluster Profiles"
	1) Press Add ("+" mark) -> Custom -> Torque
	2) Press "Edit" button on the right bottom of the window
	3) Go to the bottom of the activated window
	4) Type ssh on the second from the bottom box
   	(Remote shell command to call on UNIX when running communicating jobs)
	5) Type scp on the last box
   	(Remote copy command for non-shared file systems)

	(Note: Name of the profile can be changed from the Cluster Profile box on the left)
	(Note: "parcluster('ProfileName')" returns profile setup -> check SSH and SCP section)

STEP 2: Run submission script
	1) Once done, launch matlab on text mode and run job script (without .m):
	($: Linux terminal, >: Matlab command window)
	   $ module load matlab
	   $ matlab -nodisplay -nosplash -r <Script_Name>
	   or
	   $ matlab -nodisplay -nosplash
	   > run <Script_Name>
	2) Check if job is on queue ($ qstat -u PSUID)

	Screen/tmux session may be used if terminal cannot be opened for all time.
	Regarding screen/tmux session, please ssh to same node:
	$ ssh PSUID@146.186.1.23

STEP 3: Check the result or output
	Method 1 (Save output to text file):
	"diary(JobName, 'OutputFile.txt')" must be on the submission script, all command line 		output will be stored in OutputFile.txt.
	(Note: load(JobName) should not be used)
	
	Method 2 (Check output via GUI):
	Use ACI-I to open Matlab GUI. Type following line on Matlab command window:
	> LD_LIBRARY_PATH /usr/lib64/:LD_LIBRARY_PATH
	Then, right click a job from Job Monitor and press "Show Diary"


########## Sample submission command ##########
$ module load matlab
$ matlab -nodisplay -nosplash -r cluster_test

Requested resource can be easily changed but last number on the following line
must be smaller than total number of processors:

jj = batch(Cluster, 'testpar','pool',19);

(i.e. 19 if 20 processors are requested)
